          linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”). You
          agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and

          modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We
          will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date
          of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific
          notice of each such change. Please ensure that you check the
          applicable Terms every time you use our Site so that you understand
          which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have
          been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised

          revised Terms of Use are posted. The information provided on the Site
          is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in
          any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be

          registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
          Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other
          locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
          compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
          applicable.
